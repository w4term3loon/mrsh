	Abstract = {Hash functions are a widespread class of functions in computer science and used in several applications, e.g. in computer forensics to identify known files. One basic property of cryptographic Hash Functions is the avalanche effect that causes a significantly different output if an input is changed slightly. As some applications also need to identify similar files (e.g. spam/virus detection) this raised the need for Similarity Preserving Hashing. In recent years, several approaches came up, all with different namings, properties, strengths and weaknesses which is due to a missing definition.},
